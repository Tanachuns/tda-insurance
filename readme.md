# Tool used
  React (Frontend) / Express (Backend)
  
# Installation Guide
  Normally you don't need any installation to be able to playaround with this application, all you need is to go to the link of our application.

# User story
  This is a fully CRUD operation application and there are two types of users in our application 1.insurance buyer 2.admin user\
  \
  Insurance buyer (end user)\
  Once user get into the main page they will have to either go for log-in or sign-up (if they are new user) after they sign-up for the application then they will be able 
  to directly go into mainpage and see all insurance packages and they are now free to select any package that suit them. Additionally, user will also be able to go 
  into their profile and edit their personal information if they want to. Finally, both user information and and their selected package will be store in the database
  using Postgresql.\
  \
  Admin user\
  For the admin user they will be allow to (add / edit / update / delete) all insurance packages and admin user are also allow to delete any user out of the system. Thus, admin user account will already be initiallize in the application
  which mean that if we want to add more admin user into the system only the first admin will authorize for create new admin user.
  
# What we've learn from the project
  Communication is playing an importance role when it's come to group project and also in the real work place environment. So, each and everyone of us learnt to work 
  and talk to each other on the first day of the project. The difficult part is when we find out that some of our member group still can't get a good grasp on backend
  developement concept. After that, we quickly rearrange the task again base on their strenght and interest. However, most importantly we would like to thank for everyone
  in the team that willing to help each other. Additionally, another big part that we learnt is how to use git as a team work environment and that is go back again into
  communication part. Lastly, we are now have a lot better understanding about how to integrate between frontend and backend.
